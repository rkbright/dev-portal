# Developer portal for Sports World Central APIs
This is the code for the developer portal website for the Sports World Central
APIs. These are example projects demonstrating API best practices using Python.
The website is built and deployed using GitHub Pages. This is the published
website address: https://{your GitHub ID}.github.io/dev-portal/
This repository was cloned from the LaunchAny Minimum Viable Portal repository:
https://github.com/launchany/mvp-template. If you would like to create your
open portal, I recommend referencing that original project.
